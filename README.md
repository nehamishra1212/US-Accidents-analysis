# US-Accidents-analysis

Reducing traffic accidents is an important public safety challenge around the world. Accident prediction is important for optimizing public transportation, enabling safer routes, and cost-effectively improving the transportation infrastructure, all in order to make the roads safer.
Given its significance, accident analysis and prediction has been a topic of much research in the past few decades. US-Accidents offers a wide range of data attributes to describe each accident record including location data, time data, natural language description of event, weather data, period-of-day information, and relevant points-of-interest data (traffic signal, stop sign, etc.).
The aim of the project is to analyze if the weather conditions (rainy, foggy, snow, high temperature, drizzle), time of the day (early morning, morning, noon, evening, night), part of the week, temperature has some relation /impact on accidents.
